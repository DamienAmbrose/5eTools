>In a world that insists and demands of control over every aspect of our digital lives, some of us wonder *"why?"*
>
>Why is it that we must mindlessly oblige to these immaterial and arbitrary rules enforced upon us without reason- without need- without **justice**.
>
>In this dystopian world we live in, we must seek solace in a communal experience so immaterial, arbitrary, and meaningless as the rules we seek to break:

### Step 1: 
Download and extract the source code. Look for `Code > Download Zip` on this repository's Code page. Alternatively, clone it via Git or SSH if you feel comfortable.

### Step 2:
Move your newly downloaded repository folder (titled "5eTools") to your home directory (the folder which contains your Desktop and Documents folders).

>[!WARNING]
> Make sure there aren't any subfolders in the folder you unzipped. The folder `5eTools` should contain the folders `audio`, `css`, and so on. If there
>is another folder inside `5eTools` (probably *also* called "5eTools"), move **this** folder to your home directory, instead of the original folder.

### Step 3:
`5eTools` contains a utility file called 5e.desktop. Copy this file into `~/.local/share/applications`. The `.local` folder is in the same directory you moved the `5eTools` folder
in **Step 2**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To view the `.local` folder, you may need to show hidden files and folders in your file manager. In Nautilus, hit `Ctrl+H` or navigate to and check `Menu > Show Hidden Files`.

### Step 4:
Return to your home directory. Rename the `5eTools` folder to `.5e`. Make sure this folder contains the folders referenced in **Step 2**.
>[!WARNING]
>No shell scripts will work correctly if the folder is incorrectly named, or if it is a redundant wrapper folder.

> [!TIP]
> After you finish installation, configure your file manager to hide hidden items again. Check **Step 2**.
